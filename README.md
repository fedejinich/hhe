# HHE (Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption) SDK
This SDK provides an implementation of hybrid homomorphic encryption for single-user scenarios using PASTA symmetric cipher and BFV homomorphic encryption scheme. 

## Intro 
The goal of this project is to provide a solution for hybrid homomorphic encryption in single-user scenarios. The proposed solution combines the BFV homomorphic encryption scheme with the Pasta symmetric cipher to create a hybrid homomorphic scheme that provides both security and efficiency.
